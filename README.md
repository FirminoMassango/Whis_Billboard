Whis_Billboard

This is a script written in Python language. While coding my goal was to get the Billboard's Chart, the current version only displays 4 categories and I'm planning on adding more categories.

This code is based in the billboard.py API


To use the script first of all you must run this command in your terminal: pip install billboard.py

And then run the command: python whis_hotbillboard.py
