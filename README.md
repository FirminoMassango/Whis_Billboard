<h1>Whis_Billboard</h1>

This is a script written in Python language. While coding my goal was to get the Billboard's Chart, the current version only displays 4 categories and I'm planning on adding more categories.

This code is based in the billboard.py API


<h5>To use the script first of all you need to run these commands on the command line:</h5>

<blockquote>pip install -r requirements.txt</blockquote>

<blockquote>python whis_hotbillboard.py </blockquote>
